### Project Description: Quiz Application Using Spring Boot

#### Overview
The Quiz Application is a project designed to help you understand the fundamentals of Spring Boot and Java web development. This application allows users to create, take, and manage quizzes, making it an excellent introduction to backend development, RESTful APIs, and basic database management.

#### Objectives
- Develop a web-based quiz application using Spring Boot.
- Implement features for user registration and authentication.
- Create functionalities for quiz creation, participation, and result tracking.
- Gain hands-on experience with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf (or any front-end framework), and a relational database (e.g., H2 or MySQL).

#### Key Features
1. **User Registration and Authentication**
   - Allow users to register and log in.
   - Secure user data with password hashing.

2. **Quiz Creation and Management**
   - Enable logged-in users to create quizzes with questions and multiple-choice answers.
   - Provide options to edit or delete existing quizzes.

3. **Quiz Participation**
   - Allow users to take quizzes and submit their answers.
   - Provide instant feedback on quiz performance.

4. **Results Tracking**
   - Store and display usersâ€™ quiz results and scores.
   - Implement a leaderboard to encourage competition.

5. **Responsive User Interface**
   - Build a simple, user-friendly interface using Thymeleaf or a JavaScript framework like React/Vue.
   - Ensure the app is mobile-friendly.

#### Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Java
- **Frontend:** Thymeleaf (or React/Vue)
- **Database:** H2 (for simplicity) or MySQL
- **Build Tool:** Maven or Gradle
- **Version Control:** Git

#### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this project, you will:
- Understand the basic structure of a Spring Boot application.
- Gain experience in creating RESTful APIs.
- Learn how to connect a Spring Boot application to a database.
- Develop skills in user authentication and session management.
- Create a simple yet functional web application from scratch.

#### Getting Started
1. Set up your development environment (Java, Spring Boot, and your chosen database).
2. Initialize a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.
3. Create user and quiz models, followed by the necessary repositories and services.
4. Develop controllers for handling requests and responses.
5. Design the frontend to interact with the backend.
6. Test the application and refine it based on user feedback.

This project not only enhances your Java programming skills but also provides a solid foundation in web development principles using Spring Boot. Dive in and enjoy the process of building your very own quiz application!
